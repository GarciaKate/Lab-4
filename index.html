<h3><p style="font-family:cOMIC sANS mS;color:#000000;">Hey! I'm Kate by the way. I'm not a celebrity or an artist, and definitely not a saint. <br />
 I'm just a random girl who happened to be the winner of the olympics, specifically the <br /> 
swimming category, back when I was still a long-tailed with a cute, little head organism <br />
when my father and mother--you know. Anyway, I'm going to show you  amazing poems<br />
by this amazing poet, William Blake</p></h3>

<?h3?>The Fairy</?h3?> 
<p>
‘COME hither, my Sparrows,<br />	
My little arrows.<br />	
If a tear or a smile<br />	
Will a man beguile,<br />	
If an amorous delay<br />	 
Clouds a sunshiny day,	<br />
If the step of a foot	<br />
Smites the heart to its root,<br />	
'Tis the marriage-ring…	<br />
Makes each fairy a king.'<br />	
<br />
So a Fairy sung.<br />	
From the leaves I sprung;<br />	
He leap'd from the spray<br />	
To flee away;	<br />
But in my hat caught,	<br />
He soon shall be taught.	<br />
Let him laugh, let him cry,<br />	
He's my Butterfly;	<br />
For I've pull'd out the sting	<br />
Of the marriage-ring. <br />

<?h3?>If It Is True What The Prophets Write</?h3?> 
<p>
If it is true, what the Prophets write,<br />
That the heathen gods are all stocks and stones,<br />
Shall we, for the sake of being polite,<br />
Feed them with the juice of our marrow-bones?<br />
<br />
And if Bezaleel and Aholiab drew<br />
What the finger of God pointed to their view,<br />
Shall we suffer the Roman and Grecian rods<br />
To compel us to worship them as gods?<br />
<br />
They stole them from the temple of the Lord<br />
And worshipp'd them that they might make inspirèd art abhorr'd;<br />
<br />
The wood and stone were call'd the holy things,<br />
And their sublime intent given to their kings.<br />
All the atonements of Jehovah spurn'd,<br />
And criminals to sacrifices turn'd. <br />

<?h2?>?How Sweet I Roam'D</h2>
<p>
How sweet I roam'd from field to field,<br />
And tasted all the summer's pride<br />
'Til the prince of love beheld<br />
Who in the sunny beams did glide!<br />
<br />
He shew'd me lilies for my hair<br />
And blushing roses for my brow;<br />
He led me through his garden fair,<br />
Where all his golden pleasures grow.<br />
<br />
With sweet May dews my wings were wet,<br />
And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage<br />
He caught me in his silken net,<br />
And shut me in his golden cage.<br />
<br />
He loves to sit and hear me sing,<br />
Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;<br />
Then stretches out my golden wing,<br />
And mocks my loss of liberty. <br />

<?h2?>The Smile</?h2?> 
<p>
There is a Smile of Love <br />
And there is a Smile of Deceit <br />
And there is a Smile of Smiles<br />
In which these two Smiles meet 
<br />
And there is a Frown of Hate <br />
And there is a Frown of disdain <br />
And there is a Frown of Frowns<br />
Which you strive to forget in vain <br />
<br />
For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core <br />
And it sticks in the deep Back bone <br />
And no Smile that ever was smild <br />
But only one Smile alone<br />
<br />
That betwixt the Cradle & Grave<br />
It only once Smild can be <br />
But when it once is Smild <br />
Theres an end to all Misery <br />

<?h2?><?a? ?name?=?"section6"?>(#section6) A Poison Tree</?a?></?h2?> 
<?p?>
I was angry with my friend; <br />
I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br />
I was angry with my foe: <br />
I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br />
<br />
And I waterd

it in fears, <br />
Night & morning with my tears: <br />
And I sunned it with smiles, <br />
And with soft deceitful wiles.<br /> 
<br />
And it grew both day and night. <br />
Till it bore an apple bright. <br />
And my foe beheld it shine, <br />
And he knew that it was mine. <br />
<br />
And into my garden stole, <br />
When the night had veild the pole; <br />
In the morning glad I see; <br />
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.<br />
